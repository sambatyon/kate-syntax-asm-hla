Kate Syntax Highlighting for High-Level Assembly
================================================

So I decided to start learning assembly, for that I am using the book
[The Art of Assembly Language](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9781593272074.do).
However is difficult to find good resources for it, so I decided to create my
own syntax highlighter. It is not yet complete but things are going.
